## 5. Dashboard Component (`pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
**Before:** Feature-heavy dashboard with:
- Detailed card layouts with icons and backgrounds
- Complex grid systems
- Extensive help sections for evaluators
- Multiple UI states and loading animations

**After:** Clean, functional dashboard:
- Simplified card layouts
- Essential functionality preserved
- Cleaner grid system
- Removed evaluator tips section

## 6. Transactions Component (`pages/Transactions.jsx`)
**Before:** Production-level transactions management with:
- Complex URL parameter handling
- Advanced pagination system
- Multiple filter options
- Complex form state management
- Advanced search functionality

**After:** Simple transactions list:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Simple table layout
- Essential form handling
- Removed complex filtering and pagination

## 7. Common Components
- **Loader:** Simplified from multiple size options to single loading state
- **Dependencies:** Removed `remark-gfm` plugin dependency
- **Backup files:** Cleaned up `.bak` files

## Lines of Code Reduction
- **auth.js:** ~300 lines → ~25 lines (92% reduction)
- **api.js:** ~400 lines → ~60 lines (85% reduction) 
- **AIInsights.jsx:** ~150 lines → ~70 lines (53% reduction)

**Total reduction:** ~1,880 lines → ~625 lines (67% reduction)

## Benefits of Simplification
1. **Easier to understand:** Removed complex production patterns
2. **Faster development:** Less boilerplate code
3. **Reduced dependencies:** Fewer npm packages
4. **Better maintainability:** Cleaner, more focused code
5. **Suitable for demo:** Keeps essential functionality while being simpler

## What Was Preserved
- Core functionality (CRUD operations)
- User authentication
- AI insights integration  
- Receipt upload capability
- Analytics and charts
- Responsive design
- Essential error handling

## What Was Removed
- Complex error handling scenarios
- Production-level authentication features
- Advanced filtering and pagination
